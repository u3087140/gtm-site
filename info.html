<h4>14. WHATS THE DEAL WITH CAMERAS AND TAKING FOOTAGE AT GTM?</h4>

<p>First and foremost, please respect the privacy of all other patrons, artists and service providers at GTM when using your camera or mobile phone. 

Professional still cameras (such as an SLR), professional video cameras (including go-pros), sound recording equipment and professional lighting and tripod set ups are not permitted at GTM without written authority from the Promoters. 

Any patron with equipment of this description wont be allowed to bring it in.
It will be up to the patron to find somewhere to store it until the end of the event or choose to not enter the event. 
Small still cameras (including those with a recording function) and mobile phones are permitted for your own personal use, however:

Any photos or footage taken cannot be sold or published without written authority from the Promoters. 
Any photos or footage taken is to be used for your personal use only  sharing it with friends via uploading it to your personal Facebook and instagram account is fine.
Before you upload something to Facebook or instagram, have a think about whether youd be happy with someone else uploading that exact photo or footage of you. It might seem funny at the time, but possibly not the following day.</p>

<p>Sorry, but no. We aren't allowed to have animals at the event. Guide dogs are OK.  </p>

<p>Yes BUT only if youre 18 years of age or over and you bring your valid photo ID with you. No valid photo ID means no alcohol.
